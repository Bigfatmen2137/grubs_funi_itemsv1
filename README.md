This is my first minecraft plugin ( still a work in progress ) that i decided to make, so that i can learn java while playing minecraft.
List of items as of v. 1.2.1:
Walmart terminator ( my attemt of implementing the terminator bow from Hypixel Skyblock)
Math Axe ( a bad version of the wand from WorldEdit plugin )
Magic Wand ( turns any block you click into a gold block ( yes very complicated ))
